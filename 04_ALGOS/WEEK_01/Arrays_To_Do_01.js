//Shuffle
//In JavaScript, the Array object has numerous useful methods.
//It does not, however, contain a method that will randomize
//the order of an array’s elements. Let’s create shuffle(arr),
//to efficiently shuffle a given array’s values. Work in-place,
//naturally. Do you need to return anything from your function?

//ANSWER
// Yes, we would need the results of the shuffled Array (Result).


//Skyline Heights
//Lovely Burbank has a breathtaking view of the Los Angeles skyline.
//Let’s say you are given an array with heights of consecutive buildings,
//starting closest to you and extending away. Array [-1,7,3] would
//represent three buildings: first is actually out of view below street
//level, behind it is second at 7 stories high, third is 3 stories
//high (hidden behind the 7-story). You are situated at street level.
//Return array containing heights of buildings you can see, in order.
//Given [-1,1,1,7,3] return [1,7]. Given [0,4] return [4].
//As always with challenges, do not use built-in array functions such as unshift().

function skyline_View(array_One){
    
}


//Zip It
//Create a standalone function that accepts two arrays and combines
//their values sequentially into a new array. Extra values from either
//array should be included afterward. Given [4,15,100] and [10,20,30,40],
//return new array containing [4,10,15,20,30,40,100].

function combine_Array(array_One, array_Two){

//Credit Card Validation (Bonus)
//The Luhn formula is sometimes used to validate credit card numbers. Create the function isCreditCardValid(digitArr) that accepts an array of digits on the card (13-19 depending on the card), and returns a boolean whether the card digits satisfy the Luhn formula, as follows:
