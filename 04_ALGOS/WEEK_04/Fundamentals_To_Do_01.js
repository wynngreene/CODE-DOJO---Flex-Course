//1. Multiples of Three â€“ but Not All
//Using FOR, print multiples of 3 from -300 to 0. Skip -3 and -6.

 

//2. Printing Integers with While
//Print integers from 2000 to 5280, using a WHILE.

 

//3. Counting, the Dojo Way
//Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If by 10, also print " Dojo".

 

//4. Flexible Countdown
//Given lowNum, highNum, mult, print multiples of mult from highNum down to lowNum, using a FOR. For (2,9,3), print 9 6 3 (on successive lines).
